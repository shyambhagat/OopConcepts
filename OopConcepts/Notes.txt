OopConcepts Project Notes

Overview
Demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Key Concepts

- Encapsulation
  - Bundles data and methods within classes.
  - Example: `Bank` class with private fields and public methods.

- Inheritance
  - Creates subclasses that inherit from a superclass.
  - Example: `Branch` class inherits from `Bank`.

- Polymorphism
  - Methods behave differently based on the object calling them.
  - Example: Overriding methods in the `Branch` class.

- Abstraction
  - Hides complex details, showing only necessary features.
  - Example: Abstract classes or interfaces.

Application
Practical examples, like bank operations, demonstrate OOP principles in a real-world context.
