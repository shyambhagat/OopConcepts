PolymorphismConcepts Project Notes

Overview
Demonstrates polymorphism in C# through method overriding, method overloading, and abstract classes.

Key Classes

- Person Class
  - Abstract base class with common properties and methods.
  - Provides virtual GetLoan method for loan calculation.
  - Base CalculateBonus method for bonus calculation.

- Employee Class
  - Inherits from Person.
  - Overrides GetLoan method to customize loan eligibility.
  - Overloads CalculateBonus with various implementations based on different criteria.

- Contractor Class
  - Inherits from Person.
  - Uses base class implementations for GetLoan and CalculateBonus.

Application
Simulates real-world scenarios involving employees and contractors to demonstrate OOP principles like polymorphism, including method overriding and overloading.
