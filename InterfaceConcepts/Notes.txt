InterfaceConcepts Project Notes

Overview
Demonstrates the use of interfaces in C# to define a contract for customer management operations using a CSV file as a basic database.

Key Components

- Customer Class
  - Represents customer data with properties like FullName, Address, City, Region, PostalCode, and Country.

- CustomerRepository Class
  - Implements IReadCrudLogic, ICrudOperation, and IMultiCrudOperations interfaces.
  - Manages customer data stored in a CSV file, providing methods to add, update, delete, and retrieve customers.

- ICrudOperation Interface
  - Defines basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing customer data.

- IMultiCrudOperations Interface
  - Adds methods to perform batch operations like adding or updating multiple customers at once.

- IReadCrudLogic Interface
  - Provides methods for reading customer data, such as getting all customers or retrieving a customer by ID.

Application
This example models a customer management system where data is stored in a CSV file. It uses interfaces to ensure consistent implementation of CRUD operations across different classes and allows for managing customers efficiently.
