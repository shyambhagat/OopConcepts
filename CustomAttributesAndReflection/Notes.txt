CustomAttributesAndReflection - Project Notes

Overview:
This project demonstrates the use of custom attributes in C#, focusing on validation and auditing within a product order and customer management scenario. The project includes creating custom validation attributes, applying them to class properties, and using reflection to validate, read, and set these properties dynamically.

Key Concepts:

1. Custom Attributes:
   - CustomRequiredAttribute: Ensures that a property value is not null or empty.
   - CustomMinLengthAttribute: Validates that a string property meets a minimum length requirement.
   - CustomRangeAttribute: Validates that a numeric property value falls within a specified range.
   - CustomEmailAttribute: Ensures that a string property is in a valid email format.

2. Applying Attributes:
   - The custom attributes are applied to properties in the Customer, Product, and Order classes to enforce specific validation rules.
   - Example:
     - CustomerId in the Customer class is decorated with CustomRequiredAttribute.
     - Name in the Customer class is decorated with CustomMinLengthAttribute.
     - Email in the Customer class is decorated with CustomEmailAttribute.
     - Price in the Product class is decorated with CustomRangeAttribute.

3. Reflection:
   - Reflection is used to:
     - Validate Properties: The ValidateObject method iterates through an object's properties and applies the validation logic defined by the custom attributes.
     - Read Property Values: The ReadPropertyValues method reads and prints the values of all properties of an object.
     - Set Property Values: The SetPropertyValue method sets the value of a specified property dynamically.

Practical Usage:

- Validation: Ensures that the object properties adhere to business rules before processing, storing, or displaying them.
- Reflection: Provides a powerful way to interact with objects dynamically, enabling operations like validation, auditing, and property manipulation without hard-coding logic.

Conclusion:

The CustomAttributesAndReflection project showcases the practical use of custom attributes and reflection in C#. By using custom validation attributes, the project enforces business rules in a clear and maintainable manner. Reflection allows for dynamic interaction with objects, making the code flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.
