# OOP Concepts Projects

This repository contains a collection of C# projects demonstrating various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and other advanced C# features. Each project focuses on a specific concept or set of concepts, providing practical examples to help you understand and apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Project List

### OOPConcepts
This project covers the fundamental OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

### EncapsulationConcepts
Demonstrates encapsulation by showing how data and methods can be bundled into classes with controlled access using access modifiers (private, protected, internal, public).

### InheritanceConcepts
Explores inheritance, where classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.

### PolymorphismConcepts
Covers polymorphism, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class while still exhibiting behavior specific to their actual class.

### PropertiesConcepts
Focuses on properties in C#, including auto-implemented properties, read-only properties, and calculated properties.

### Operator_Overloading
Shows how to overload operators in C# to allow custom behavior when using operators with class instances.

### Abstract_Classes
Demonstrates abstract classes and methods, which provide a base class that cannot be instantiated but can be inherited by other classes.

### InterfaceConcepts
Covers interfaces, which define a contract that classes can implement, allowing for a more flexible and decoupled design.

### ConstructorConcepts
Explores different types of constructors in C#, including default constructors, parameterized constructors, and copy constructors.

### StaticMembersConcepts
Focuses on static members in C#, including static classes, methods, fields, and properties, which are shared across all instances of a class.

### IndexersConcepts
Demonstrates indexers, which allow objects to be indexed like arrays, providing a way to access elements using an index.

### DelegatesAndEventsConcepts
Covers delegates and events in C#, providing a way to pass methods as arguments and handle events in an event-driven programming model.

### GenericsConcepts
Explores generics, which allow for the creation of classes, methods, and interfaces that work with any data type, providing type safety and reducing code duplication.

### FunctionalConcepts
Covers functional programming concepts in C#, including functors, actions, predicates, and the use of lambda expressions.

### AnonymousMethodsAndTypes
Demonstrates the use of anonymous methods and types in C#, providing a way to define methods inline and create types without explicitly defining a class.

### AdvancedLINQConcepts
Explores advanced LINQ techniques, including filtering, grouping, joining, and working with custom objects and complex types.

### PartialConcepts
Focuses on partial classes and methods, allowing the definition of a class or method to be split across multiple files, improving code organization.

### NewLanguageFeatures
Covers new language features in C#, including readonly fields, init-only setters, with-expressions, target-typed new expressions, and more.

### NullableConcepts
Explores nullable reference types and nullable value types in C#, which provide a way to indicate whether a type can be null.

### ExtensionMethodsConcepts
Demonstrates extension methods, which allow you to extend existing types with new methods without modifying the original type.

### ExceptionHandlingConcepts
Covers best practices for exception handling in C#, including custom exception classes, try-catch-finally, exception propagation, and logging.

### NewKeywordsConcepts
Explores new C# keywords, including the is operator with pattern matching, as operator, typeof, nameof, and others.

### ConversionConcepts
Focuses on type conversion in C#, including boxing/unboxing, type casting, TryParse methods, and user-defined conversions.

### CustomAttributesAndReflection
Demonstrates the creation and use of custom attributes in C#, as well as using reflection to read and apply these attributes dynamically.

### MemoryManagementConcepts
Explores memory management in .NET, focusing on garbage collection, finalization, and the IDisposable pattern.

## How to Use

Each project is self-contained and can be opened in Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET projects. Simply open the solution file and explore the projects to see practical implementations of various OOP and C# concepts.
